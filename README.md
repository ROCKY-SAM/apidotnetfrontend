## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

ng add ngx-bootstrap  



You may first proceed with npm uninstall @schematics/angular and TERMINAL informs that "removed XX packages and audited XXXX packages" etc, then you may implement npm install @schematics/angular@9.1.0.

Accordingly, ng add ngx-bootstrap provides:

✅️ Added "bootstrap

✅️ Added "ngx-bootstrap


npm install font-awesome

ng g c nav --skip-tests

ng g s account --skip-tests


So we've reached the end of Section five, which was all about clients, log in and register and let's

just review the learning goals that we should hopefully have achieved by the end of this particular

section.

So we've implemented the log in and register functionality, as well as hopefully understanding about

creating components using the angular CLI.

We now have several components in our application.

We've also taken a look at forms and how we can use to way binding to get data from our templates into

our component and also the other way as well.

We've taken a look at angular services and a couple of points that I'd like you to remember is the fact

that Angella services are singletons.

This makes them a good place to share data between components and we will be doing that later on.

And we've also taken a look at observables and we've looked at a few different ways of how we can subscribe

to observables.

And we also took a look at the async pipe, which automatically subscribes and unsubscribes from observables

without us needing to manually use the subscribe method.

We've also seen the pipe and how we can transform data that we get back inside unobservable.

We've also taken a look at angular structural directives to conditionally display information on a page.

And we've looked at communication between parent and child as well.

In terms of those input and output properties.

Don't worry about not fully understanding about anything that we've covered in this particular section.

What we do in this course is we use everything that we're talking about now.

These are the building blocks of any Anjelah application.

And as we build more of our application, your understanding will grow of what we're doing here.

And what we're going to take a look at next is rooting in our application.
